## Instacart Basket Analysis
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns
The goal is to align marketing strategies with customer preferences and uncover growth opportunities within Instacart's offerings.

## Introduction
As part of Instacart's analytics team, the company aims to gain deeper insights into its sales patterns. The task at hand is to conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and propose strategies for better segmentation.

## Key Questions & Objective
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours 

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 

The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?

○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

○ Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?

○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
customers are ordering?
